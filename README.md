# Introduction

Inspired by [Gmap Pedometer](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/), I was
looking for a project to really dive into AngularJS. With an
updated interface and feature parity, where I also learned a lot about
Bootstrap and Google Maps integration.

# Usage

A [Goolge Map API](https://developers.google.com/maps/signup) key is required to run the application.

```sh
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY='myspecialkey'" > .env
bundle install
foreman start
open http://localhost:9292
```
